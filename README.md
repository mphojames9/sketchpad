# Etch-a-Sketch

This is the Etch-a-Sketch project from the curriculum of The Odin Project's.

## Goal
Create a browser version of the toy sketchpad.

## Built With:

HTML

CSS

JavaScript


## Learning Outcomes

Used CSS Grids and Flex to display the cells.
More understanding of the organization of HTML elements.
The real issue I had was trying to figure out how to best fit a square into a responsive web page.
The layout I ended up with seems to work well for normal browser window sizes, but I don't know that I took the best approach.
I can say I fanally familiarized myself with the Chrome developer tools.
